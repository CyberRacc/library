# CyberRacc Library

Small library project for The Odin Project.

## To-Do
- Add persistent storage so that books can be added and removed and those changes be remembered after a refresh.
- Refactor entire codebase to use classes rather than plain object constructors.
## Project Goals
- To make use of object constructors to create a functional library.
- The library must be able to add and remove books.

## What I learned during this project
- How to properly create object constructors and use them to create new objects.
- How to more granually alter the DOM with JavaScript.
